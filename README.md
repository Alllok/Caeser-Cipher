# Caeser-Cipher
First internship project in prodigy infotech

This repository contains a simple Python script to perform encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher technique. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features

Encryption: Shift characters in the input text by a specified number of positions to encrypt the message.

Decryption: Shift characters in the input text by a specified number of positions in the opposite direction to decrypt the message.

Case Sensitivity: Retains the case of the original message, handling both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.
Non-alphabet Characters: Preserves non-alphabet characters (such as punctuation and spaces) in the input text.

Usage: To use the script, simply run it in a Python environment and follow the prompts:

Direction: Choose whether you want to encrypt (E) or decrypt (D) the message.
Message: Enter the text message you wish to process.
Shift Value: Enter the integer shift value to use for the Caesar cipher.

The script will then output the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.
